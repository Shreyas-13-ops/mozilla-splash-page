# Welcome to my first web project!
- I created this web page to learn basics of HTML from MDN Web Docs - Learn Web Development.
- This source code is published on github via commit and publish features from my local repo to remote repo(github).

## More Details:
1. First section(below header text) of the page you will find a video and a little introduction about 'Mozilla community'.
2. Second section(.further-info) you will find 4 images/logo's which contains links to useful content on Mozilla Community.
3. The final section below, you will find a cute red panda resting on a wooden trunk.
