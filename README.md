# Welcome to my first web project!
- I created this web page to implement my knowledge on HTML, thanks to "MDN Web Docs - Learn Web Development".
- This source code is published on github via github desktop GUI using commit and publish features from my local repo to remote repo(github).

## More Details:
1. First section (below header text - Mozilla) of the page you will find a video and a short introduction about 'Mozilla community'.
2. Second section (.further-info) you will find 4 images/logo's which contains links to useful content on Mozilla Web Docs and other pages from Mozilla Firefox.
3. The final section below, you will find a cute red panda resting on a wooden trunk.
